# VRM addon for Godot Engine

This Godot addon partially implements an importer for models with the [VRM specification, version 0.0](https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/tree/master/specification/0.0).

## What is VRM?

See [https://vrm.dev/en/](https://vrm.dev/en/) (English) or [https://vrm.dev/](https://vrm.dev/) (日本語)

"VRM" is a file format for handling 3D humanoid avatar (3D model) data for VR applications.
It is based on [glTF 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/). Anyone is free to use it.
